Checking out the connections, I was able to find the IP which is marked malicious and has comparatively high upload.

It also shows traditional infostealer activity like reading cookies. Using this, it seems safe to assume that all of the accounts posting this from Discord were affected accounts.

Guess I should have connected the dots between the amount of nitro phishing URLs popping up and an infostealer. I had some suspicion about it being a generic fake login page, as I never checked out any of the sites, but didn't really think it would be an infostealer like, well, how it is revealed.</pre>

I assume the "RUSSIAN FEDERATION" part is referring to Russia. I can check and see if there's anything relating to Kanzas.
This is about where I can get it down to. Throwing the top address line returns no results.

As for Kanzas LLC, couldn't find much about them besides having IPs listed on AbuseIPDB.
